The path to seeking an education in software engineering has been in the making for me for some years. I had access to, and an interest in computers and software from a young age, and that interest coincided with my musical and artistic endeavours. It started with games, the still new internet, and the rise of creative software and has persisted a long with my interests into my career choices. 

In my music, I build patches for synthesizers, route audio signals through my digital audio workstation, and apply the principals of electro accoustics to various aspects of the music hat I create. Music making is problem solving as well as creative, a close relative of and a type of engineering. Through experience, one finds working formulas for issues in phase cancellation, perceived volume changes and competing frequencies for "space" in the music, all challenges that require technical solutions a long the signal path. 

My path thus far has been varied, but at some point, my curiosity and drive to learn software engineering got the best of me and I started investigating this coding thing. There are so many resources, but I had to learn how to approach coding from an engineering perspective, a concept that I have come to embrace, and work to excersize every day. It was only natural that my career reflect my interests, and there are so many, maybe infinite possible applications for sofware that I get really excited to work, and create with that in mind. I'm so looking forward to learning with the Flatiron School and though I expect it will be a challenge, I am looking foward to building my skills and becoming an engineer, ready to create new solutions, fix challenging problems, and maybe invent some new ways of doing it on the way.
