#### Just within reach
There's a lot to talk about in this, my second post, while I am here learning with the great teachers and students at Flat Iron. I've learned so much in a small space of time and I can say that the first project and it's requirements really bring together the concepts that I have worked on thus far. I have come to realize that learning to code is only a very small part of becoming an engineer. Part of the process is becoming comfortable with not knowing the answer, but instead knowing how to find a solution that takes into account certain constraints and requirements, a much more complex but also rewarding experience!

#### My first project
This brings me to my first project which I have decided will center around two of my favorite things, music and David Bowie. I decided that I wanted to build a program that allows users to learn a bit about the many, many albums that Bowie made in his time, I also wanted to inject a bit of fun while doing it, so I included quotes and some ASCII art on the way. This was my first foray into API's which has been a super fun experience! Seeing all the Ruby methods, creating classes, building an API and CLI classes and bringing it all together has been a real eye opener. I had the impression of some of the capability one could implement through coding through some past experimentation but this project, though I assume is relatively simple, really illustrates for a beginner the possibilities. 

#### Pivot!
Upon reviewing one of the videos I realized that there was a brief mention of not using any API's associated with the one used in the example, WHICH I TOTALLY DID! So after having built and refactored my code (at my level of course) I realized this and immediately began work finding another API. I was worried that time was running close, but also up until then I had put into practice what I was learning, so I buckled down and found an even better API, altered my code, and made it work! I'm actually pretty happy it turned out that way because the hashes I had to work with were a lot more complex which allowed me to really dive in, debug, and work the problems. 

#### Better than before
Here's what I've learned, always read it again, double check and make sure, be ready to pivot, and always learn from your successes and mistakes in turn. I still have so much to learn, but I can already look back and see I have learned so much. With that I am excited to see what else we will learn.
