### I can see the end of this part of my journey
Transitioning from pure Javascript to JS/React, React/Redux and going back to integrate Ruby on Rails was an exercise in really testing the limits of how much one can learn in a short time. They said it would be tough and they weren't downplaying it! Not only did we learn React and Redux, but we learned to implement it with technology we utilized in previous modules to make a full stack application. The process has taught me a lot about my ability, my strengths and areas that I need to continue to work on as I go forward into the job market. 

### Be prepared to always learn, but take care of yourself on the way
Some important areas to focus on include Async, Thunk implementation, Components, Containers, and making routes in your app. With some added complexity in terms of concepts, the app become dense, but practical in their compartmentalization. It makes sense why we want to separate concerns, and keep things simple, unidirectional and single purpose.

### This is hard, but you have help
My word of advice on this module, is get ahead while you can, and really focus on self care so you can learn and retain the volume of information you will get here. It was an interesting feeling to simultaneously understand, and also not understand what was being shown. Certain idiosyncrasies exist within software engineering, and those basic rules kind of bear out, but it take some getting used to to understand not only implementation of these various technologies but also to develop a level of understanding where one knows the right tools for a particular engineering challenge. 

### Ask directions, test yourself, rely on wht you've learned
As always, even with great instructors, and content, you have to be ready to hit the search engine to get answers to your questions because they won't always be there when you are off on your own hunting for that perfect job. Practice really does make perfect, and in this case, for someone like me, repetition is going to really help me become more comfortable with some of the complexities. It takes a lot of work, and if you are really dedicated or simply need more time, much of ones day will be consumed with the contents of this course. 

### You can get to the next goal, and then the next
I have found that my ways of approaching all manner of problems have taken on a different, and more deliberate methodology. My own hobbies, one of which is music production has benefited greatly from my time at Flatiron. Looking back, the curriculum increased in complexity at a pace and level that was just out of my comfort zone, and occasionally way out of it. But the supportive faculty and staff have been so great, and so generous with their help at every turn. I look forward to what the future brings, and have so much hope for all the great people, projects and new technologies that await!
