## Purpose
The Know Soft Character Builder application is made to allow users to create a simple character concept for a Cyberpunk Red character. The user has the ability to view the created characters, create a user account which then allows them to create, edit and delete characters they have created.

## Build
For this project I really enjoyed learning about the waySinatra works with Ruby and Active Record, as well as HTML and CSS. Bring together the various technologies we have been learning helped me to understand their place in the bigger picture. I utilized the MVC structure for this application and implemented full CRUD functionality in my character model. After some of the SQL labs, it was nice to allow ActiveRecord to take care of some of the more mundane tasks for the database. I was cool implementing validation, generating the appropriate errors and showing them to the user in the web app.

## Challenges
There's a lot going on with this project, so managing learning, actual building, and understanding all the connectivity can be a challenge. I found for me, besides the complexity, it was super important to understand the relationship between the models, controllers and views and how they work together. 

In the end this project was as challenging as it has been a great teacher. I felt it really reinforced earlier concepts from the first project but nicely builds on what we learned.
