*A question: What determines the keys in a params hash?*

The Answer: It's magical. Rails magic can be mystifying, in other words, what's going on behind the brim of that top hat is not always obvious. 

The Details in the magic (hint, there's 2 answers): 
The :name in our form_for example provide the key:
```
<%= form_for(@synth) do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :name %>
  <%= f.text_field :name %><br>
```
It's the name of the attribute from the field in the above HTML form that provides the key. So they key could be whatever you name it!

* In a POST request, params will get passed to the controller usually from a form.


* In a GET request, params get passed to the controller from the URL in the userâ€™s browser.<br>

EXAMPLE: `get '/synths/:id', to: 'synths#show'` <br>
*So entering '/synths/1', means 1 is the params.*

```
def show
    @synth = Synth.find(params[:id])
  end
```

In this show action we can see that the dynamic segment :id will get passed the :id from the URL. In keeping with the above example, we would get a Synth with an ID of 1.



### What about Strong Params?

Strong params protects your database by only allowing certain "whitelisted" attributes to be saved to the database.

```
def synth_params
    params.require(:synth).permit(:name, :brand, :hybrid, :price, :description)
  end
```

***Require*** looks for params[:synth] in the above example, and will throw an error if it's not there, it also prevents the bad data from being saved. ***Permit*** is followed by the list of permitted attributes. Once everything passes the save occurs! In short, we use Strong Params to protect the Database from bad data. 

You can see it in use here passed in to a new Synth that we'll make and save with ***Create***:
```
def create
    @synth = Synth.new(synth_params)
```
